# Explanation of mathematical expressions
It is impossible to imagine programming without simple mathematical expressions, so our practice begins with a chapter dedicated to explaining simple mathematical operations. In addition, when we learn how to explain these simple constructions, it will be easier for us to explain more complex constructions using variables and other expressions.

Let's start with the most common mathematical signs and actions.

## Addition
The sign **"+"** called **plus** and the action that this sign performs is called **addition**.
For example, the expression `2 + 3 = 5` is explained as **"Two plus three equals five"**.
We can also say it in another way, for example, like this: **"the sum of two and three is equal to five"**.

## Subtraction
The sign that is used to subtract **"-"** is called minus. And this action is explained as follows: **something minus something equals something**. For example, when we explain the expression `9 - 5 = 4`, we say: **"Nine minus five equals four"**.

## Multiplication
When we talk about multiplication, we almost never pronounce the name of the sign that is used for this. But in any case, you should know that this sign **"*"** is called an **asterisk**. Instead of the word "asterisk" we use the word "times" between the multiplied numbers. For example, `4 * 7 = 28` is explained as **"Four times seven equals twenty-eight"**.

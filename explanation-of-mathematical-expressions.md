# Explanation of mathematical expressions
It is impossible to imagine programming without simple mathematical expressions, so our practice begins with a chapter dedicated to explaining simple mathematical operations. In addition, when we learn how to explain these simple constructions, it will be easier for us to explain more complex constructions using variables and other expressions.

Let's start with the most common mathematical signs and actions.

## Addition
The sign **"+"** called **plus** and the action that this sign performs is called **addition**.
For example, the expression `2 + 3 = 5` is explained as **"Two plus three equals five"**.
We can also say it in another way, for example, like this: **"the sum of two and three is equal to five"**.

## Subtraction
The sign that is used to subtract **"-"** is called minus. And this action is explained as follows: **something minus something equals something**. For example, when we explain the expression `9 - 5 = 4`, we say: **"Nine minus five equals four"**.

## Multiplication
When we talk about multiplication, we almost never pronounce the name of the sign that is used for this. But in any case, you should know that this sign **"*"** is called an **asterisk**. Instead of the word "asterisk" we use the word "times" between the multiplied numbers. For example, `4 * 7 = 28` is explained as **"Four times seven equals twenty-eight"**.

## Division
To divide one number by another, we use the **"/"** sign, called a forward slash. To explain this expression `6 / 2 = 3` we can say: **"Six divided by two equals three"**.

## More complicated expressions
Firs, let's learn that signs **"()"** called parentheses. We know that an expression enclosed in parentheses is executed earlier than others.
Let's see how we can explain this kind of expression:
- `(2 + 3) * 3 = 15` - Two plus three, multiplied by three, equals fifteen.
- `(3 + 3) / 3 = 2` - Three plus three, divided by three, equals two.
- `12 / (4 x 3) = 1` - Twelve divided by four times three, equals one.
- `5 + (6 - 2) = 9` - Five plus (six minus two) equals nine.

## Comparisons
Very often, when we explain some conditions in our code, we use comparisons that can be explained in the following ways:
- `2 < 5` - Two is less than five.
- `4 > 2` - Four is greater than two.
- `A <= B` - A is less than or equal to B.
- `A >= C` - A is greater than or equal to C.
- `A == A` - A is equal to C.

# Explanations of working with variables
When we work with variables, we can create them, and if they are not constants, we can change their values. Let's see how we can describe this kind of action.

```javascript
let height;
```
I create a variable called `height` using the keyword `let`.

```javascript
height = 9;
```
And now I can assign it the value nine.

```javascript
const weight = 60;
```
Let's create a constant variable called `weight` and assign it the value sixty.

```javascript
let num = 60;
num = num + 3;
num = num - 10;
```
I'll create a variable `num` and assign it the value five. Then I increment the value of `num` by adding three to it. After that I decrement this value by subtracting teen.

```javascript
let numOfSiblings = 1 + 3;
```
Firs, we create a variable called `numOfSiblings` and assign it the value of '1 + 3'.
```javascript
let numOfThings = 8;
```
Then we create the variable `numOfThings` and assign eight to it.
```javascript
console.log(numOfThings / numOfSiblings); // it gives 2
```
After that we output result of division `numOfThings` by `numOfSiblings`, code works out and gives us two.

In the following chapters we will learn how to describe actions with arrays and objects, and this will allow us to describe more complex and interesting things.
